<!--  So there is something called semantic HTMl(remember I asked you about it from the beginning), so if you are to follow the use of semantic html, you should avoid
    using div for almost everything-->
    <!--  You should have something like <nav></nav> for navigation if you have any, and then <main></main> to contain all your contents, <footer></footer> if you have any footer details on the page     -->
   
    
    <!--      so for example, the div below can be a <main></main>-->
